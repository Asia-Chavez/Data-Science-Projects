## Projects Overview

| Project | Description | Link |
|---|-------------|------|
| **Modeling Car Insurance Outcomes** | Classification experiments to predict insurance claims; includes feature selection, model benchmarking, and diagnostics. | `Modeling_Car_Insurance_Outcomes/` |
| **Predicting Medical Insurance Charges** | Regression modeling to estimate health insurance costs; includes data cleaning, encoding, evaluation, and validation. | `Predicting_Insurance_Charges/` |
| **Penguin Species Clustering (In Progress)** | Unsupervised learning to cluster penguins based on physical measurements and infer species groups. | `Penguin_Species_Clustering/` |
